/**
 * A middleware that aids in building complex apps that are fronted by other
 * middleware in a "middleware stack". Also provides several other useful methods
 * for request mapping and routing that make this middleware a good choice when
 * working with mach at a high level or when getting started for the first time.
 *
 * Middleware are placed into the stack by calling the `use` method which passes
 * along any additional arguments that it receives directly on to the middleware
 * when the stack is compiled.
 *
 * Other stacks can be created and "mounted" easily at various locations using the
 * `map` method. Calls to `use` and `map` are interleaved so that stacks created using
 * `map` only run after middleware that is placed before them in the stack, and not after.
 *
 * Stacks also have URL-based request routing built in when using a mach.router as the
 * downstream app, which is the default. Any routes that you define run *after* all other
 * middleware in the stack. Also, mapping takes precedence to routing so e.g. if a
 * route matches a mapped location it is ignored.
 *
 *   var app = mach.stack();
 *
 *   app.use(mach.gzip);
 *   app.use(mach.file, __dirname + '/public');
 *
 *   // Use a little image server to serve requests that begin
 *   // with /images out of /public/img.
 *   app.map('/images', function (app) {
 *     app.use(mach.file, __dirname + '/public/img');
 *   });
 *
 *   // Since this call is *after* the call to map, this middleware
 *   // will not run when requests begin with "/images".
 *   app.use(mach.params);
 *
 *   app.get('/', function (request) {
 *     return "The params are: " + JSON.stringify(request.params);
 *   });
 *
 *   app.post('/posts/:post_id/messages', function (request) {
 *     // ...
 *   });
 *
 *   mach.serve(app);
 *
 * Note: A stack is compiled the first time it is called. When a stack is
 * compiled, all middleware is invoked with the downstream app plus any
 * additional arguments that were passed to the call to stack.use. As long as
 * the stack doesn't change between requests, this happens only once.
